# NNFromScratch

Goal: Impliment a neural network from scratch in C++ to use on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

Contents:
1. Matrix Library
2. Neural Network

The MNIST dataset can be found here - http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
The csv files are not included in this repository as the files are too large. 

Results:

With a 20 node hidden layer and training on 59,000 images, the neural network achieved an accuracy of 91.4% on 1000 test images.
